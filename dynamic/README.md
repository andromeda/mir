# mir-da

Dynamically analyze JavaScript programs to extract or enforce RWX sets.

mir-da <fl> [bfmp] [i=<tm>]

  <fl>                        File to start analysis from; defaults to index.js if it exists

  -h,   --help:               Output (this) help 
  -V    --version:            Output version information
  -v, vv, vvv, --verbosity:   Add (multiple) verbosity levels

  -d,   --depth <n>:          Object depth to analyze (default 3)
  -e,   --enforce <f.json>:   Run in enforcement mode, where mir enforces access rules in <f.json>
  -r,   --report <f.json>:    Run in reporting mode, where mir simply reports on invalid accesses in <f.json>
  -s,   --save <f.json>:      File to output resuslts
  -p,   --print [<out, err>]: Stream to output results (defaults to file, see above)

  --module-exclude <m>:       Comma-separated list of module IDs (absolute fs paths) to be excluded from the analysis
  --module-include <m>:       Comma-separated list of module IDs (absolute fs paths) to be included (assumes module-exclude='*')
  --context-exclude <c>:      Comma-separated context starting points to exclude from tracking (for contexts, see below)
  --context-include <c>:      Comma-separated context starting points to include in tracking  (assumes context-exclude='*')
  --prop-exclude <p>:         Comma-separated property names to exclude from analysis (e.g., 'Promise,toString,escape,setImmediate')
  --prop-include <p>:         Comma-separated property names to include in the  analysis (assumes prop-exclude='*')


  Contexts <c> are coarse groups of  program elements that are tracked, and fall
  under these categories (can be included in their long or short form):

  * module-locals, m:         Module-local names such as 'require'
  * node-globals, n:          All Node.js-related globals, such as 'console' and 'process'
  * es-globals, e:            All EcmaScript 6 globals names such Math.sin or 
  * user-globals, g:          User-defined globals accessed with a 'global' prefix, e.g., 'global.y = 3'
  * with-globals, w:          User-defined globals accessed without a prefix, e.g., 'y = 3' (expensive to track)
